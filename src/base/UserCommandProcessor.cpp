    // also embedded in
    // the contract, acknowledges the ServerID, then the user can encrypt

    // public key in the contract, without asking the server for a copy of that
    // key.
    //
    // Only the private key who signed that contract will be able to read the
    // communications from
    // the user.
    //
    // I definitely have to build in an option for x509 certs to be used in lieu
    // of public keys.
    // Otherwise the key is not ever revokable -- yet it's in a contract!  What
    // is the issuer supposed
    // to do if that key is stolen? Make a public announcement?
    //
    // UPDATE ONE-LINE NOTE: THE TRUE SOLUTION TO THIS WHOLE ISSUE IS:   ***
    // NAMECOIN ***
    // (Now continuing back to my old comments from 18 months ago...)
    //
    // In such a case, the issuer would have to put a "check this URL to make
    // sure contract still good"
    // variable into the contract so that the users have the chance to make sure
    // the contract is still
    // good and the contract's private key hasn't been stolen. Well guess what?
    // That's what x509 does.
    // Therefore the appropriate solution is for the server to support x509s,
    // and to look up the authority
    // and verify certs, so that users have recourse in the event their private
    // key is stolen. (They can
    // just use their Cert to issue a new public key, which the transaction
    // server would be smart enough
    // to use, once the certificate authority signs off on it. (Since the user
    // uses an x509 from a
    // specific authority, then I can trust that whatever that authority says,
    // that user wanted it to say.)
    // Without knowing the authority itself, I can now trust it because the user
    // has asked me to trust it.
    // Fair enough!
    //
    // Similarly a user should be able to use his x509 Cert instead of his
    // public key, and the server
    // should verify that cert whenever it's used to make sure it's up to date.
    // This takes the
    // problem off of the user's hands by way of a trusted authority.
    //
    // In fact this transaction server is really just a transaction VERIFIER.
    // It's just another form
    // of trusted 3rd party. Just like Verisign is an authority who ceritifies
    // an identity, so this
    // server is an authority who certifies a transaction. It's like a
    // timestamping server. In fact
    // it should have timestamping built in as one of the functions.
    //
    // Transactions do not actually occur on the server, per se. They occur
    // between the USERS.
    // All the server does it certify that the numbers are correct. It's like
    // accounting software.
    // Ultimately the users are the ones making a transaction, and they are the
    // ones who are
    // responsible to back up their promises in real life and potentially in
    // court. All the software
    // does is CERTIFY that the users DID make certain agreements at certain
    // times, and digitally sign
    // those certifications.
    //
    // Thus, this server is very similar to Verisign. It is a trusted 3rd party
    // who users can trust
    // to authenticate their transactions. Instead of authenticating
    // certifications like Verisign does,
    // it authenticates transactions.
    //
    // UPDATE: May not want x509's after all, since it provides an opening for
    // governments to
    // serve warrants on the authority site and switch certs whenever they want
    // to (BAD THING!)

    // On the client side, whenever the client is DEFINITELY made aware of the
    // existence of a
    // server reply, he adds its request number to this list, which is sent
    // along with all client-side
    // requests to the server.
    // The server reads the list on the incoming client message (and it uses
    // these same functions
    // to store its own internal list.) If the # already appears on its internal
    // list, then it does
    // nothing. Otherwise, it loads up the Nymbox and removes the replyNotice,
    // and then adds the #
    // to its internal list.
    // For any numbers on the internal list but NOT on the client's list, the
    // server removes from
    // the internal list. (The client removed them when it saw the server's
    // internal list, which the
    // server sends with its replies.)
    //
    // This entire protocol, densely described, is unnecessary for OT to
    // function, but is great for
    // optimization, as it enables OT to avoid downloading all Box Receipts
    // containing replyNotices,
    // as long as the original reply was properly received when the request was
    // originally sent (which
    // is MOST of the time...)
    // Thus we can eliminate most replyNotice downloads, and likely a large % of

  Allows ANY Nym to GET AND SET the Usage Credits for ANY other Nym!
  UPDATE: Only the override Nym can change the credits,
  You might ask, "But what if I don't want users to be able to set the Usage
  Credits?"
  That makes sense: Go to ~/.ot/server.cfg and set cmd_usage_credits=false
  (which is its default BTW.)
  That way, NO ONE can set credits, or view them for other people. (People can
  still view their own.)
  But you might ask, "But what if I want the ADMIN to still be able to set and
  view credits?"
  That makes sense: Just make sure the override_nym_id in server.cfg is set to
  your admin Nym, and
  that Nym will STILL be able to use this message:
